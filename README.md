100 Days of Python: My Journey to Becoming a Software Developer

About Me

Hi, 
I'm SackOfPotatoes, and I’m on a mission to turn my dream of becoming a software developer into reality. 
My journey is guided by a deep passion for technology and a commitment to lifelong learning. 
With a background in IT HelpDesk support, I’m now diving headfirst into the world of coding.
Why 100 Days of Python?

Python is not just a powerful programming language; 
it’s an excellent starting point for building a wide range of skills, 
from web development to data science. Through this challenge, 
I aim to solidify my understanding of core concepts, 
explore advanced topics, and ultimately grow into a capable software developer.

My Goals

#TODO    Learn the fundamentals of Python.

#TODO    Build real-world projects to demonstrate my skills.

#TODO    Document my progress daily, sharing what I learn.

#TODO    Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the developer community.


How You Can Support Me

Follow my journey, provide feedback, and share insights. Together, we can learn and grow!

P.S
Days 1-15 where mostly just learning the basics and syntax. 
I'll be uploading on days that had projects and challanges where I had to build the project on my own.
